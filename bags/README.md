## Files quackgpt_manual_easy, quackgpt_joystick_easy quackgpt_joystick_hard

These files have a bag file with a corresponding capture file from a vicon capture system. 
We noticed after the capture that the vicon computer has a delay of 2h00m09s/2h00m10s compared to real-time. 
We need to take this into consideration when running the tests. Here is some additionnal information about each run:

- **quackgpt_manual_easy**: This one was taken by moving the duckiebot manually (by hand). It should be the easiest capture.
- **quackgpt_joystick_easy**: This one was taken by moving the duckiebot with the joystick, in a hopefully not so jittery way.
- **quackgpt_joystick_hard**: This one is a failed attempt at moving the robot across. It's a hard challenge as sometimes the apriltags get out of view and the duckiebot doesn't move predictably.

Here is a map with the April tags numbers:
